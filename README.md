- Hi, I’m Andrea Meda, Phd student at The University of Edinburgh, the supervisors of the project are Francesco Tudisco, Kostantinos Zygalakis and Miguel Anjos.
- I graduated at master level in Applied Mathematics in 2022, in a double degree joint program between University of Verona (IT) and Ensimag at Grenoble INP (FR). My dissertation is titled "Wasserstein distributionally robust shape and topology optimization", a paper has also been published together with the supervisors of the thesis; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-023-03500-4
- I’m interested in continuous optimization, riemannian geometry, numerical optimization and machine learning applications.
